# Difference between Website and Android app

An Android app is developed specifically for Android-powered devices. Designed using Java and Kotlin, this kind of native mobile applications is downloaded via Google Play Store and may take leverage of the native device specifications, like contact access, camera access, GPS location access, gallery access, etc.

Whereas, a web app is Internet-enabled application which implies it will be accessed anywhere using Internet (on web browser). The app needn't be downloaded to use and has lesser control over the native device specifications compared to native apps.
