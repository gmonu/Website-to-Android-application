# Website-to-Android-application
Its a android project which is about to convert any website to Android application. In my case i have choosen gameresidence.com and have converted it to An android application named VERSUS.
  Versus is nothing but an android application which is having a website of VERSUS website. This website is useful for those who wants to play LAN events or organize LAN gaming event of ESPORTS event.

# Difference between Website and Android app

An Android app is developed specifically for Android-powered devices. Designed using Java and Kotlin, this type of native mobile applications can be downloaded via Google Play Store and can take leverage of the native device specifications, such as contact access, camera access, GPS location access, gallery access, etc.

Whereas, a Web app is Internet-enabled application which means it can be accessed anywhere using Internet (on web browser). The app need not be downloaded to use and has lesser control over the native device specifications when compared to native apps.
